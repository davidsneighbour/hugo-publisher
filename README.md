# DNB GoHugo Component / Publisher

❗this component is under development and things will change over time. [https://kollitsch.de/contact/](contact me for details) if you are interested or open an issue if you wish to have specific features added.

Draft: This component will add a publishing workflow to Hugo content (think of author > editor > publisher, realised via Git usernames/rights and signatures) and extends status of the content (like draft, edited, published, recalled, etc.). It will give overviews of content pieces with filters by state/type/etc.

It will NOT add a secure authentication method and access limitation per content type. That is not possible with the given tools. But we can regulate user groups (author, editor, etc.) via email/name layouts of git commits and a strict githook setup.

It's an experimental system.
